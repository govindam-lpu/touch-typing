# Getting Started with Create React App



Description:
You are required to build a web-based application for touch typing. Touch typing is typing
without looking at the keyboard. The fundamental idea is that each finger is given its own
section of the keyboard and your fingers learn the location of the keyboard through practising
regularly and gaining muscle memory to eventually build up speed whilst typing.
While touch typing is a practice of keys, words & sentences. For this exercise, weâ€™ll focus only
on keys practice & only on the 8 keys of the keyboard (asdfjkl;)

#Setting up the App

npm start
